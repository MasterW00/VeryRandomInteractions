# Overview

I REALLY wanted to learn more about served content, web app server structure and whatnot. The server side was something I looked into heavily. I learned how to write the server functions myself of the sperate routes. I learned alot that I didn't know about how these webpages work on the back end. That back end stuff was my primary focus, the applications served from the server took a little bit of a back seat. The applications used some of the things I found intereseting when messing with the REST api functions mainly the get and post ones. I made the applications weird little social things to mess with my new found web server knowledge and power.

# Web Pages

The first page is a landing page with three links to, currently three, incoherant webpages.
This one does not have any dynamic elements

The first is a chat box. the chatbox is a plave you can connect to a room by name and send messages to everyone connected to that named room. The chat messages are dynamic as anyone can send a message that everyone will recive.

The Second is just a "game" its just filler because i like sneaking this into my projects.

The third is the Very Instant Grams or VIGrams. It is a place where you can share the URL to any image and it will be shared to everyone who goes to the page. The images are dynamica as you can add any image and it will change the content of the page to include it for you and everyone else.

# Future Work

* Stylesheet for each webpage
* Complete user profiles that persist in the chatrooms, VIGrams, and the "Game"
* Randomize the Image order on VIGrams
* Profile picutes and chat box interactions
* an HTML page that hosts simple mini HTML pages that you can scroll through at random
